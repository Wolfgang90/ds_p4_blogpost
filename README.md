This repository corresponds to my medium article `How to start with AirBnb in Beijing` which can be found [here](https://medium.com/@eichler_wolfgang/how-to-start-with-airbnb-in-beijing-2568561c4658).

## project dependencies
* Anaconda 5.3

## project motivation
The first thing to look at while diving into a new real estate market is about exploring the different areas in a city and the characteristics of them.
I decided to dive into the Beijing market. It is one of my favorite cities on the globe in which I also lived for some time.Â 
The analysis is based on the public AirBnb dataset for Beijing from [insideairbnb.com](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).

## project files
* Analysis.ipynb: .ipynb file containing the analysis
* Analysis.html: .html version of the .ipynb analyis file

## key analysis results
1. Beijing consists of 16 AirBnb areas with varying flat numbers
2. Main features of the AirBnb dataset connected to the area are for instance
    * price per night
    * host presence on AirBnb 
    * time of the first review for the apartment
3. The distributions of price per night per area is quite heterogenous
